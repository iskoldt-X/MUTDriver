[Dynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 evolution based on different countries](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2024.148426)

A comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 evolution based on mutation prevalence across different countries.

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis pipeline used in our study of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics across six countries (United States, United Kingdom, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Russia). The study analyzed over 13 million SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to understand mutation patterns and evolutionary trajectories during different pandemic stages.

## Data Sources
- GISAID database for SARS-CoV-2 sequences
- Our World in Data for pandemic statistics
- NCBI genetic code table and reference genome
